# Janus Scheduling and Executing System

## Overview

For now this is a pet project of mine that is a result of some of the work I've done with test automation.

The goal is to have a system that schedules and executes "things" (most likely test scripts).

Modes of scheduling:
* Campaign
* Monte Carlo
* Date-time specific
* Immediate


## Namesake
n ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus (/ˈdʒeɪnəs/ JAY-nəs; Latin: IANVS (Iānus), pronounced [ˈjaːnʊs]) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past.
